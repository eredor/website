Currently a student at [ENS Rennes in computer science](http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I aspire to be a researcher who explores biological phenomena with computers!

My interests in research gravitate towards neuroscience and the relationship human-machine but mainly around the use of computers to study and prevent diseases thanks to different procedures.

Hobby-wise I love drawing and have been doing so since I was in middle school. Lately I've been into reading about philosophy and psychology.
